# natural_images_classifiers
CNN model in Tensorflow for Natural Image detection & 

# 1 ......Downloading Dataset:
Download the Natural Image Dataset images of around 6k-7k images from link https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/natural-images.

# 2 ......Downloading Program:
In the repository 'Natural_Image_classification' check for DM_Project_Final_Likitha.ipynb and download it.

# 3 ......Setup for running Program::

Step 1 – Download the Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/natural-images

Step 2 – Download the DM_Project_Final_Likitha.ipynb file, To run this file the tensorflow-2.8.0, opencv, PIL  packages are needed.

Step 3 – Extract the downloaded dataset into the folder named “natural_images” and move the DM_Project_Final_Likitha.ipynb file into the folder at the level of the same folder.

Step 4 – Run all the cells in the notebook, the notebook gives the validation and train accuracy for every epoch.

# GUI Execution
Step 1 – Download the predict.ui and predict.py files and run the predict.py file, to run this program the package PyQt5 is needed.

Step 2 – The upload button in the GUI enables to select only the .jpg and .png files. And the prediction percentage for every class is obtained.
